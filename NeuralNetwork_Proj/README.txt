Within this simulation, we are testing a feed forward neural network on asteroids that are meant to chase a space ship. In this instance,
we have set the spaceship to rotate in a circle in order to provide constant input to train the neural network.If this were to be utilized
in a game, the user would be controlling the spaceship while asteroid logic would improve as the game continues.This would be an 
interesting way to increase difficult as the player continues to encounter more waves. In terms of results, we realized 
that as the neural network trained, there would be less haphazard collisions and improved pathing towards the space ship. The collision 
counter was used to compare results and track differences between iterations. 

In order to restart the simulate, please use the "X" to close the program then relaunch the .exe file.
